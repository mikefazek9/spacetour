# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website

![Design preview for the Space tourism website coding challenge](./preview.jpg)


## Hello and Welcome!
This is a Challenge I started with frontendmentor.io
+ All I was given was the figma design and images and text, no pre HTML, CSS or JavaScript was involed.
+ In this Challenge I used HTML5, CSS3 and some JavaScript for the navbar on mobile and Active States.
+ I impulmented a function toggle for mobile state on the hamburger menu with a CSS animations for when it is called.
+ Also used the window.location in JS for show the style for which page you are currently on when clicked upon.


****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
### HTML5

+ NO frameworks I used semantic HTML to build this, even though I could have used a framework like bootstrap or materialize
I decided to hard code alot of this, because I wanted to stick to something very basic with this project.
+ custom divs and class names.


****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
### CSS3

+ I mostly used FlexBox to help with layout of these pages, Since CSS Grid is two-dimensional I felt like there was no need for it. main layout layout of this site was columns and rows so I felt flexbox fit perfectly.
+ I used a little bit of CSS animation for the mobile navbar when you click on the hamburger it does slide out from right to left with a small delay.
+ media queries are used for the mobile side of things to fit inside of a width 414px avg Iphone and more.

####
Challenging Parts

+ some of the CSS was challenging because of the overflow on some of the containers It came out to be a easy fix with overflow and reset css.
+ JavaScript took me a min to figure out how I was going to add the active states using JS once figured out it wasn't hard to do the rest.
